Title : - Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning: Leveraging Machine Learning to Enhance Diagnosis and Prevention.

Problem statement : - Predicting and diagnosing heart disease is a paramount challenge in medicine, relying on factors like physical examinations and patient symptoms.
Influential factors include cholesterol levels, smoking, obesity, family history, blood pressure, and work environment.
Machine learning algorithms are pivotal in accurately predicting heart disease by analyzing vast amounts of data. 
Technological advancements enable the integration of machine learning with Big Data tools to manage complex datasets. 
Heart disease is globally recognized as a leading cause of mortality, stemming from the heart's inability to sufficiently circulate blood to vital organs. 
By considering various symptoms such as age, gender, and heart rate,
machine learning models can effectively predict heart disease, contributing to reduced mortality rates among patients.
